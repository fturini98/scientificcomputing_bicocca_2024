# BicoccaCoursePython2024
Python package to solve the exercices of the Bicocca's phD python course.
**Download and Install**:
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ BicoccaCoursePython2024
```

***Documentation avaiable*** [here](https://fturini98.github.io/scientificcomputing_bicocca_2024
)

The documentation contains also the ***soloutions of the exercices.***

The python package as a module for each lesson:
- Lesson 01 module ([prima_lezione](#prima_lezione))
- Lesson 02 module ([seconda_lezione](#seconda_lezione))
- Lesson 03 module ([terza_lezione](#terza_lezione))
- Lesson 04 module ([quarta_lezione](#quarta_lezione))
- [Lesson 08](#lesson-08) has no module (test, and package deployment)

# Modules
## Lesson 1 (prima_lezione)

The first is lesson is about the basics of python. For this lesson I've
developed a simple class to play tick-tack-toe game, and another 
one to generate the Pascal triangle.

## Lesson 2 (seconda_lezione)

The second lesson is about the useage of the **NumPy** library.
With NumPy I've generated a class to simulate the Conway's Game og Life.

## Lesson 03 (terza_lezione)

The third lesson is about the usage of the **matplotlib** library; with this library
I've generate a class to visualize the planetary positions and animate the previous game of life.

## Lesson 04 (quarta_lezione)

The fourth lesson is concentred on the usage of **SciPy** library; for this lesson I've developed a 
class to integrate the planetary equation of motions and show them. In this module is present
also another class that cleanup a noisy signal covolving it with a gaussian.

## Lesson 05 (Mathematica)

The fifth lesson diverge from the main topic of the course (Python), and it is concentred on **Mathematica**; A usefull program to solve symbolic equations/systems or integrate and derivate them.

## Lesson 06 (GitHub)

Also the sixth lesson is on a different topic from the main one. This lesson is on the use of GitHub and the continuous integration; for module's exercices I've choose to create a GitHub workflow to assure the presence of my name in the README file, and another to compile a pdf text using LateX.

## Lesson 07 (Numba and decorators)

The seventh lesson is about decorators **Numba** and multiprocessing. For these exercices I've tested the difference of a Markov chain that simulate a Stock Market implemented with the standard Python and implemented with Numba, and I generated a decorators to add some features to the Stock Market plot.

## Lesson 08 (tests and deployment)

The last lesson is about building a package and then **testing** and deploying it.  
I've completed the exercises related to:  
- the tests
- the deployment
