.. BicoccaCoursePython2024 documentation master file

Welcome to BicoccaCoursePython2024's documentation!
===================================================

This documentation provides for each lesson of the course done by professor `Davide Gerosa <https://davidegerosa.com/>`_ a solution for
two of his exercises. To solve them I've build a python package available on  `GitHub <https://github.com/fturini98/scientificcomputing_bicocca_2024/tree/main/Esercizi/BicoccaCoursePython2024>`_ ;
The package is divided into lessons (**python modules**) that explain different topics related to Python's use for scientific research.
For each module/lesson are also provided the jupyter' notebook with the solutions to the lesson's exercises.
